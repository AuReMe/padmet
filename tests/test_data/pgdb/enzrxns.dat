COMMENT - This enzyme, a crotonase, is part of a multienzyme complex
/that has broad substrate specificity.  It is also part of a
/multifunctional polypeptide coded for by the fadB gene.  This enzyme
/takes part in the oxidation of saturated fatty acids.  The enzyme is
/active with substrates of varying chain lengths.  |CITS: [7024730]| 
/The active site also catalyzes epimerization of unsaturated fatty
/acids (EC 5.1.2.3).  |CITS: [8454629]|
