UNIQUE-ID - Saturated-Fatty-Acyl-CoA
TYPES - ACYL-COA
COMMON-NAME - a 2,3,4-saturated fatty acyl CoA
COMMENT - This class describes |FRAME:ACYL-COA "acyl-CoAs"| that do not contain any double bonds in the 2, 3, and 4 positions.
/Acyl-CoAs are oxoacids that have been activated by |FRAME: CO-A|. They are often classified by the length of their acyl moiety.
/
/This class includes the following sub-classes:
/
/|FRAME: Short-Chain-234-Saturated-acyl-CoAs "Short-chain 2,3,4-saturated fatty acyl-CoAs"| are derived from |FRAME: Short-chain-fatty-acids "2,3,4-saturated fatty acids with aliphatic chains shorter than 6 carbons"|.
/
/|FRAME: Medium-Chain-234-Saturated-acyl-CoAs "Medium-chain 2,3,4-saturated fatty acyl-CoAs"|  are derived from |FRAME: Medium-chain-fatty-acids "fatty acids with aliphatic chains of 6-12 carbons"|.
/
/|FRAME: Long-Chain-234-Saturated-acyl-CoAs "Long-chain 2,3,4-saturated fatty acyl-CoAs"| are derived from |FRAME: Long-Chain-234-Saturated-Fatty-Acids "2,3,4-saturated fatty acids with aliphatic chains of 13-22 carbons"|.

UNIQUE-ID - ETF-Oxidized

TYPES - Modified-Proteins
TYPES - Oxidized-Flavoproteins
COMMON-NAME - an oxidized electron-transfer flavoprotein

UNIQUE-ID - ETF-Reduced
TYPES - Etf
TYPES - Reduced-Flavoproteins
COMMON-NAME - a reduced electron-transfer flavoprotein
SYNONYMS - ETFH<sub>2</sub>
SYNONYMS - a reduced ETF
SYNONYMS - a reduced electron-transferring flavoprotein
COMMENT - The electron transferring-flavoproteins (ETF) serve as specific electron carriers for other dehydrogenases. They transfer the electrons to the main respiratory chain via |FRAME: HS10326-MONOMER "ETF-ubiquinone oxidoreductase"| (ETF dehydrogenase).
/
/Most of the characterized electron-transferring flavoproteins belong to a single group. These proteins, including those from mammals |CITS: [8962055]|, plants |CITS: [16923016]|, and some bacteria, such as the methylotrophic bacterium |FRAME: TAX-2327| |CITS: [7798207]| and the soil bacterium |FRAME: TAX-266| |CITS: [10026281]|, are heterodimeric, contain one non-covalently bound FAD and one AMP per molecule, and function as electron carriers between other flavoproteins (such as |FRAME: B0221-MONOMER "acyl-CoA dehydrogenases"|, |FRAME: CPLX-6421|, and |FRAME: CPLX-7462|) and |FRAME: ETR-Quinones "a quinone"|, depending on the source species.
/
/A different type of ETF has been characterized from the anaerobic bacterium |FRAME: TAX-907|. This ETF is also a heterodimer but contains two FAD molecules. The presence of AMP has not been reported. The function of |FRAME: TAX-907| ETF is to transfer electrons between flavoproteins, |FRAME: CPLX-5242| (DLDH) and |FRAME: CPLX-7036| (BCD) |CITS: [14688238]|, and additionally to oxidize NADH |CITS: [4364030][4365840]|.
